<h3>
<span>SOME NOTES ON ARUNDEL HOUSE, STRAND, AND ON THE DISPERSION OF
   SCULPTURES FORMERLY PART OF THE ARUNDELIAN
 COLLECTION.</span>
</h3>


<p>The celebrated Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, was son of Philip Howard,
Earl of Arundel&mdash;the faithful and constant, who being persecuted for his
religion, was suffered by Queen Elizabeth to languish in the Tower,
where he died in 1595&mdash;and great-grandson of Henry Howard, Earl of
Surrey, the accomplished nobleman who was beheaded in 1547 by "the Nero
of the Tudor race." Thomas Howard was restored, as your readers know, to
the earldom of Arundel by James I., and in the reign of that king and of
Charles I., who held him in veneration, received other honours and
employments, but was yet more distinguished by his munificent patronage
of the arts and of learning. He is called "the only great subject of the
northern parts, who by his conversation and great collections set a
value" upon transalpine lands; and he began about 1614 to decorate with
the precious and costly works of art which he had collected in Greece
and in his beloved Italy, the gardens and galleries of his quaint old
palace in London, called Arundel House.</p>

<p>This mansion, or rather collection of buildings, the site of which had
been taken from the see of Bath in the time of "Protector" Somerset,
appears from Hollar's <i>Views</i> (as is stated by Mr. Cunningham in his
admirable <i>Handbook of London Past and Present</i>) to have comprised a
range of irregular buildings, principally of red brick, erected at
various periods, and combined without much regard to elegance or
uniformity; although I find the earl is said to have been the first
person who introduced uniformity in building, and to have been made
chief commissioner for promoting this object in London. This famous, and
once hospitable, mansion, stood between the gardens of Essex House on
the east, and of Somerset (then Denmark) House on the west, its pleasure
grounds coming down to the river, and commanding a fine view of the city
as far as London Bridge, and of Westminster, and westward to Nine Elms.
It is mentioned by Mr. Cunningham, that in this house Hollar drew his
well-known view of London, as seen from the roof. The earl, of whose
taste and munificence the Arundelian collections formed a noble
monument, departed this life at Padua, on the 4th of October (or, as
another account<a id="account1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> says, the 26th September), 1646, in the sixty-first
year of his age, having been two years before created Earl of Norfolk,
in consideration of his lineal descent from Thomas de Brotherton, Earl
of<a id="Page_362"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[362]</span> Norfolk, a younger son of King Edward I., and was interred at
Arundel. His will, dated at Dover, 3rd September, 1640, was proved in
the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and is printed in the <i>Howard
Anecdotes</i>. His marbles, medals, statues, books, and pictures (he is
said to have possessed "a larger number of Hans Holbein's works than any
other person, and to have been the first nobleman who set a value on
them in our nation"), formed at that period, says Sir Charles
 Young,<a id="Young2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
one of the finest and most splendid collections in England. Many of the
articles of virtu and of the books were, during his lifetime, in the
possession of Alathea, his Countess (who was a third daughter and coheir
of Gilbert Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury), from whom some of them were
obtained by his younger son, Sir William Howard, the unfortunate
Viscount Stafford (beheaded 1680, on perjured testimony); and a portion
of the marble statues and library devolved upon Henry Frederick, his
eldest son, who, in his father's lifetime, was summoned to parliament as
Lord Mowbray, and succeeded him as Earl of Arundel, and who died in
1652, leaving Thomas, his eldest son, who became Earl of Arundel,
Surrey, and Norfolk, and was, at the Restoration in 1660, restored to
the dukedom of Norfolk, with limitation to the heirs male of his father.
This nobleman died unmarried in 1677, and his brother Henry (who had
been created Earl of Norwich, and in 1672 Earl Marshal of England, to
him and the heirs male of his body, with other limitations in default)
thereupon became sixth Duke of Norfolk. By him the marbles and library
were finally dispersed.</p>

   Charles Howard of Greystoke, 8vo. Lond. 1769. The writer became

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Young2" class="label">[2]</a> In his preface to the Catalogue of MSS. given to the
   College of Arms by Henry Duke of Norfolk (not published).</p>

<p>The Royal Society had held their meetings since the Fire of London at
Arundel House; and John Evelyn, Esq., author of the <i>Sylva</i>, one of the
founders of the society, observing in 1667</p>

<p class="blockquot">"these precious monuments miserably neglected, and scattered up
   and down about the garden and other parts of Arundel House, and
   how exceedingly the corrosive air of London impaired them,"</p>


<p class="noindent">induced this nobleman, then Mr. Henry Howard, to bestow on the
University of Oxford</p>

<p class="blockquot">"his Arundelian marbles, those celebrated and famous
   inscriptions, Greek and Latine, gathered with so much cost and
   industrie from Greece, by his illustrious grandfather the
   magnificent Earl of Arundel."&mdash;<i>Diary</i>, vol. ii. p. 295.</p>

<p class="noindent">In 1676 Mr. Evelyn induced the Duke to grant to the Royal Society the
Arundel library, into which many of the MSS. formerly belonging to Lord
William Howard (the famous ancestor of the Earl of Carlisle), who died
in 1640, had found their way from Naworth Castle in the lifetime of
Thomas, Earl of Arundel. In the same volume of Evelyn's <i>Diary</i>, p.
445., is a minute, under date 29th August, 1678, from which it appears
that he was then called to take charge of the books and MSS., and remove
to the then home of the Royal Society in Gresham College, such of them
as did not relate to the office of Earl Marshal and to heraldry, his
grace intending to bestow the books relating to those subjects upon the
Heralds' College. It is known, however, that many chronicles and
historical MSS. of great value formed part of the donation to the
College of Arms; and it would appear from a document in the handwriting
of Sir William Dugdale, referred to by Sir Charles Young, that many
monastic registers and cartularies which were taken to Gresham College,
had nevertheless been intended by the Duke for the College over which,
as Earl Marshal, he presided. This nobleman died 1684.</p>

<p>In 1678, according to Mr. Cunningham (who quotes Walpole's <i>Anecdotes</i>,
ii. 153.), Arundel House itself was demolished. This was done pursuant
to an act of parliament, which had been obtained for the purpose of
entailing the estate on heirs male, exempt from being charged with
jointures or debts, and empowering the Duke to let a part of the site of
the house and gardens to builders, at reserved ground-rents, which were
to form a fund for building a mansion for the family on that part of the
gardens adjacent to the river. The house was planned by Wren, but the
design was laid aside about the year 1690, when Henry, seventh Duke of
Norfolk, who was a favourite of William Prince of Orange, obtained an
act of parliament empowering him to lease the remainder of the
garden-ground for a term of forty-one years, and to appropriate to
himself the fund which had accumulated. He accordingly let the ground to
Mr. Stone of New Inn, an attorney, and buildings of a very different
character to the palatial mansion that had been contemplated, ere long
overspread the site of Arundel House. The seventh duke died in 1701. It
appears that his friend King William had made him Governor of Windsor
Castle; but at his death 12,000<i>l.</i> were due to him for arrears of
salary, which sum it is said was never paid.</p>

<p>The museum of objects illustrative of natural history, and great part of
the furniture of Arundel House, were removed to Stafford House (situated
without Buckingham Gate, where Stafford Row was subsequently built), in
which house, in the year 1720, the Duchess of Norfolk, consort of
Thomas, eighth Duke, sold an immense quantity of plate, jewels,
furniture, pictures, and curiosities. Besides these, however, many
family <i>reliques</i> were at that time in the hands of different branches
of this noble family, as, for example, the grace-cup of St. Thomas of
Canterbury (which had belonged to<a id="Page_363"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[363]</span> Thomas Earl of Arundel, and is
now in the possession of Philip Henry Howard, Esq., of Corby Castle,
M.P.), and the staff of office of High Constable of England, formerly
used by the Earl, and which in 1757 was in the possession of the Earl of
Stafford.</p>

<p>Of the fate of the marbles which remained at the time of the removal of
Arundel House, some interesting particulars are given by Mr. James
Theobald in a letter written from Surrey Street, 10th May, 1757, and
addressed to Lord Willoughby de Parham, President of the Society of
Antiquaries; and believing that these particulars are little known, I
will now subjoin them to the somewhat lengthy memoranda which I have
written by way of introduction.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "As there were many fine statues, basso-relievos, and marbles,
   they were received," says Mr. Theobald, "into the lower part of
   the gardens, and many of them were placed under a colonnade
   there; and the upper part of the grounds, next the Strand, was
   let to builders, who continued the street next the Strand, from
   Temple Bar towards Westminster, and built thereon the several
   streets called Arundel, Norfolk, and Surrey Streets, leading from
   the Strand as far as the cross street called Howard Street, which
   ran parallel therewith. A cross wall was built to separate the
   ground let for building from that reserved for the family
   mansion; and many of the workmen, to save the expense of carrying
   away the rubbish, threw it over this cross wall, where it fell
   upon the colonnade and at last by its weight broke it down, and
   falling upon the statues, &amp;c. placed there, broke several of
   them. A great part of these statues, &amp;c., in that sad condition,
   were purchased by Sir William Fermor, from whom the present Earl
   of Pomfret is descended, and he removed them to his seat at
   Easton Neston in Northamptonshire, where he employed some
   statuary to repair such as were not too much demolished. There
   they continued until the year 1755, when the present countess
   made a present of them to the University of Oxford. In this
   collection was the famous sleeping Cupid represented lying on a
   lion's skin to express his absolute dominion over fierceness and
   strength, some roses being scattered on the skin, probably as
   emblems of silence and secrecy, as Cupid presented that flower to
   Harpocrates, the god of silence, as a bribe to him to conceal the
   amours of his mother, to whom the rose is also supposed to be
   sacred. Below the foot of Cupid on the cushion is the figure of a
   lizard, which some have supposed to have been placed here as a
   known ingredient of great efficacy in love-charms; others, as a
   proper attendant on those who sleep, from an opinion that this
   reptile wakes them on approach of danger. But the real design of
   the sculptor is, rather to perpetuate his name by this symbol,
   for it was Saurus. The Romans, observing how much the Grecian
   sculptors excelled them in this art, whenever they employed them
   to execute any work of this sort forbade them to put, as had been
   customary, their names to their works; and Pliny tells us that
   Saurus had recourse to this expedient, by putting the lizard upon
   this figure, as well as on another which he executed jointly with
   Batrachus, on which they were not permitted to put their names,
   therefore they placed on the bases the figures of a frog and a
   lizard.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Some other of these broken statues, not thought worth replacing,
   were begged by one Boyder Cuper, who had been a servant (I think
   gardener) to the family, and were removed by him to decorate a
   piece of garden ground which he had taken opposite Somerset
   water-gate, in the parish of Lambeth,<a id="Lambeth3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which at that time was a
   place of resort for the citizens and others in holiday time,
   still called after him by the name of Cuper's, and thence
   corruptly Cupid's Gardens, which were much of the same nature as
   Sadler's Wells and Mary'bone Gardens. Here they continued for a
   considerable time, till Mr. John Freeman of Fawley Court, near
   Henley-on-Thames, and Mr. Edward Waller of Beaconsfield,
   observing something masterly in the designs and drapery of
   several of them, desired I would treat with Mr. John Cuper for
   them. I agreed with him for 75<i>l</i>., and soon afterwards they were
   divided between these two gentlemen, and sent part to Fawley
   Court, and part to Beaconsfield, where they at present remain.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"What statues and broken fragments yet remained undisposed of in
   Arundel Gardens, the Duke of Norfolk obtained leave from the
   Crown to remove across the water, just on the opposite shore, to
   a piece of waste ground in the manor of Kennington, belonging to
   the principality of Wales; and one Mr. Arundel, a relation of the
   Duke's I think, at the latter end of the reign of King Charles
   II. or King James II., did obtain a grant of the said piece of
   ground at a small rent for a term of years, which was renewed on
   paying a fine. (These are again referred to.)</p>

<p class="blockquot">"What were thought not worth removing were buried in the
   foundations of the buildings in the lower parts of Norfolk Street
   and the other buildings on the gardens. Mr. Aislabie, who
   inhabited one of these houses, found a broken statue in his
   cellar, which he carried to his seat in Yorkshire; and he tells
   me there is a sarcophagus in the cellar of Mr. James Adamson, who
   lives in the corner house on the left hand going into the lower
   part of Norfolk Street.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "As to those carried over the water and laid on the Prince of
   Wales' ground, Mr. Arundel, soon after he obtained the grant of
   the ground, let it for a timber-yard, and the person who took it
   built up a wharf; and when the foundation of St. Paul's was laid
   (Mr. Cunningham gives 1st May, 1674, as the date when the ground
   began to be cleared), great quantities of the rubbish were
   brought over thither to raise the ground which used to be
   overflowed every spring tide, so that, by degrees, these statues
   and other marbles were buried under the rubbish, and lay there
   for many years forgotten. About 1712 this piece of ground was
   rented by my father, who, on digging foundations, frequently met
   with some of these broken fragments, which were taken up and laid
   on the surface of the ground. The late Earl of Burlington having
   heard of<a id="Page_364"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[364]</span> the things which had been dug up, and that they
   had formed part of the Arundel collection, chose what he pleased
   and carried them down to Chiswick House, where he placed one
   piece of basso-relievo on the pedestal of an obelisk he erected
   there. Some years after this, the Right Hon. Lord Petre, speaking
   to me about these things of the Earl of Burlington's, told me he
   had heard that on some parts of my ground there were still many
   valuable fragments buried, and obtained my leave to employ men to
   bore the ground. After six days' searching of every part, just as
   they were going to give over, they fell upon something which gave
   them hopes, and upon opening the ground they discovered six
   statues without heads or arms, lying close to each other, some of
   a colossal size, the drapery of which was thought to be
   exceedingly fine. These were soon afterwards sent down to
   Worksop, the seat of his present Grace the Duke of Norfolk, in
   Nottinghamshire, where they remain.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"There were some few blocks of a greyish veined marble, out of
   which I endeavoured to cut some chimney-pieces and slabs to lay
   in my house, the Belvedere in Lambeth parish, over against York
   Buildings, but the expense was more than their worth; however, as
   they were cut out, some of them were used. The fragment of a
   column I carried into Berkshire to my house, Waltham Place, and
   converted it into a roller for my bowling-green, it being about
   six feet long and eighteen inches diameter."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#Lambeth3" class="label">[3]</a> Mr. Cunningham mentions that the Waterloo Bridge
   Road now runs over the very centre of these gardens.</p>

<p>Sic transit gloria mundi!</p>

<p>Such are the particulars recorded by Mr. Theobald. When I met with them
lately, I determined on asking a place for this Note in your valuable

<h3>
<span>PANSLAVIC LITERATURE, AND THE LIBRARY OF THE
BRITISH MUSEUM.</span>
</h3>

<p>There existed, even in ancient times, some connecting links between the
<i>Panslavian</i> and the <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> races: the most important, the
introduction of Wickliff's Bible translation into Czechia by Anne,
sister of Wenceslaw IV., and wife of Richard II. of England,&mdash;an event
rich in great and salutary consequences. In allusion to the Library of
the British Museum, it seems to me that in former times the diplomatic
agents of this country must have taken care to collect the rare and
interesting works of the places where they temporarily resided; and that
in this way the libraries of this country became enriched by an
astounding stock of Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Panslavic works,
which subsequently merged some way or other in the national library.
This, albeit hypothetical <i>genesis</i> of that huge collection, will, I
think, best explain its incompleteness and even <i>un-systematicity</i> in
former times; as there are some rare old works to be found, of which the
concluding volume is wanting. But I shall not, on this occasion,
<i>review</i> a whole library, but confine myself to its late <i>exponent</i> for
the world-exhibition, described in the "<i>Short Guide to that Portion of
the Library of Printed Books now open to the Public</i>, <i>May 1851</i>."</p>

<p>In imitation of the National Library of Paris, a number of books have
been publicly exhibited in the British Museum which, on account of their
early date, rarity, costliness and splendour of printing, binding, or
for certain interesting autographs, deserved general attention; thus
forming an exemplified memorial and history of typographic art and
enterprise. The show was a grand and instructive one, owing mostly to
the specimens of the unmatched collection of the Grenville Library, the
greatest gift ever bequeathed by an individual to a people. None could
look without deep emotion on the set of Columbus' Letters, all printed
during his lifetime (1493 <i>et seq.</i>)&mdash;documents much adverted to by A.
Humboldt in his <i>Examen Critique</i> on the discovery of America. Of
similar interest were the sets of first editions of Petrarca, Cervantes,
Camoens&mdash;leaves invaluable to the thinker on human civilisation.
Chinese, Indian, and Japanese specimens were also not wanting.</p>

<p>With all that, the gentleman who had arranged <i>en maestro</i> this
exhibition, did completely ignore the existence of <i>Panslavic</i>
literature, viz. that of a race of sixty millions of people! It is the
perusal of the <i>Short Guide</i> which will satisfy any one of the exactness
of the assertions, that <i>not one single</i> Russian, Polish, Czechian or
Serbian book or fly-leaf was in the whole collection: an anomaly, the
explaining of which is beyond my reach.</p>

<p>Still, Panslavia occupies a conspicuous place even in the history of
typography and literature, although our later periods have been dimmed
by the intrusion of foreign or despotic princes. It was so early as the
year 1512, that a Slavonic translation of the Bible was begun. Ivan IV.
established the first printing-press in 1564 at Moscow; and in 1659 the
learned Patriarch Nikon published a revision of both the Old and New
Testaments. Without entering here into an investigation on the first
Slavian typographers, both Czechia and Poland were foremost in
introducing this important discovery; and even our southernmost city,
the Republic of Ragusa, printed Slavian works. Of all this the
typographical exhibition of the British Museum contained no trace. What
the Library may possess or not possess, is now more difficult to
ascertain than ever, as the different sets of Catalogues amount to a
couple of hundred volumes. In fact, I know that there exist in the
Library the <i>Acta Fratrum Polonorum</i> (the disciples of Socinus), a work
unknown even to Lellewel but I am not aware how to find it<a id="Page_365"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[365]</span>
without a great loss of time.<a id="time4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>  Unfortunately also, the Catalogues are
encumbered by a host of exploded German works, which, remaining on the
hands of the Leipzig publishers, are mostly sold as waste paper. The
works of the greatest Slavian literati are wanting; for instance,
Palacky's <i>History of Czechia</i> (in German), published by order and at
the expense of the house of representatives at Prague, of which a
<i>second</i> edition (reprint) has already appeared so far back as 1844.</p>

<h3>
<span>ON ARCHBISHOP USSHER.</span>
</h3>


<p>Without designing to take part in the question at issue regarding
archbishop Ussher, I may be permitted to record the evidence of one of
the earliest and best-informed witnesses on it&mdash;Nicholas Bernard, doctor
of divinity, and preacher to the honourable society of <i>Grayes-Inne</i>,
London.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "<i>Anno 1641.</i> The great businesse of the <i>Earle of Strafford</i>
   came in agitation, in which there is one thing he gave me a
   charge, as I had occasion, to clear him, <i>viz.</i> of a <i>scandall</i>
   raised on him, by a <i>rash</i>, I will not say malicious pen, in his
   <i>Vocall forrest</i>, as if he had made use of a pretended
   distinction of a <i>Personall and politicall conscience</i>, to
   satisfy the late King, that he might consent to the beheading of
   the said Earle; that <i>though the first resisted, he might do it
   by the second;</i> which, I wonder men of prudence, or that had any
   esteem of him, could be so credulous of: but there is a
   presumptuous <i>Observator</i> of late, hath more ridiculously and
   maliciously abused him in it, as if the root of it was in
   revenge, for the <i>Earles suppressing the Articles of Ireland;</i>
   both are of the like falshood, as hath been already made
   apparent, in an answer to him.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "And I have lately seen it under the hand of a person of quality,
   affirming, that some yeers agone, a rumour being spread of the
   death of this Reverend <i>Primate</i> (who was much lamented at
   Oxford) and this concerning the Earle being by one then objected
   against him. He was an ear-witnesse, that the late <i>King</i>,
   answered that person in very great Passion, and with an oath
   protested his innocency therein."</p>

<p>Bernard received ordination from the hands of Ussher; was his librarian
at the period in question; and was honoured with his confidence for
thirty years. His <i>Life</i> of Ussher is a work of authority, and deserves
to be held in remembrance.</p>

<h3>
<span>ANGLO-CATHOLIC LIBRARY&mdash;BISHOP OVERALL'S
CONVOCATION BOOK.</span>
</h3>

<p>The volume which is known under the title of Bishop Overall's
<i>Convocation Book</i>, is a document possessing no ordinary degree of
interest. It consists of a series of arguments and canons, in which are
discussed and decided several questions of great moment relative to the
authority of princes, the divine right of episcopacy, and the
differences between the Church of England and the see of Rome. Though
this document never obtained the sanction of the Crown, yet its
intrinsic value is considerable; and its claim to be regarded as an
authentic exposition of the doctrine of the Church of England, in the
beginning of the seventeenth century, is unquestionable. Drawn up by the
eminent divines who constituted the lower house of the Convocation of
1603, the signature of Bishop Overall at the end attests that the whole
had been read three times in the hearing of the house, and unanimously
approved.<a id="approved5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> </p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn5"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#approved5" class="label">[5]</a> "Hæc omnia suprascripta ter lecta sunt in domo

<p class="footnote i3"> "April 16. 1606."</p>

<p class="footnote"> The whole of this passage, the editor informs us, "is in the
   handwriting of Overall."&mdash;P. 272.</p>


<p>In the year 1844, a new edition of this document was issued to the
subscribers to the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology. Some care and
labour appear to have been bestowed in editing it. The name of the
editor is not given: the preface does not even bear his initials.
Consequently, the Committee, whose names are before the public, and to
whom, as the subscribers are informed in the Rules of the Society, "the
whole management of the fund subscribed is entrusted,"<a id="entrusted6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> have taken on
themselves the entire and sole responsibility of this edition, and are
the only parties in any way answerable to the subscribers, for the
manner in which it has been prepared for publication.</p>


<p class="footnote"><a id="fn6"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#entrusted6" class="label">[6]</a> The fifth rule is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote i3"> "5. That the whole management of the fund subscribed be entrusted
   to a Committee, consisting of not less than twelve nor more than
   twenty-four subscribers, who shall fill up all vacancies that may
   occur in their own body."</p>


<p>How that has been done the following observations may help to determine.</p>

<p>In the second part of the work this passage occurs (book ii. chap.
vii.):&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "In these times it may well be granted that there was no need of
   any other bishops but the Apostles, and likewise that then their
   churches or particular congregations in every city were advised
   and directed touching points of religion in manner and form
   aforesaid by the common and joint advice of their priests or
   ministers. In which respect, the same persons, who then were
   named priests or ministers, were also in a general sense called
   bishops. Howbeit this course dured not long, either concerning
   their said common direction, or their names of bishops so
   attributed unto them; but was shortly after ordered far
   otherwise, by a common decree of the Apostles, to be observed in
   all<a id="Page_366"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[366]</span> such cities where particular churches were planted,
   or, as one speaketh, <i>in toto orbe</i> 'throughout the world.'"</p>

<p>This passage will be found at p. 136. of the edition in the
<i>Anglo-Catholic Library</i>, and at the foot of the page is the reference
given by the Convocation to the words "<i>in toto orbe</i>."</p>

     <p class="blockquot"> "<i>Jerome in Ep. ad Tit.</i> cap. i. [See note O.]"</p>

<p>The words within brackets direct us to one of the notes which the editor
has added at the end of the volume; where, at p. 281., the following is
found:</p>

<p>"Note O., p. 136.</p>


<p class="blockquot">"<i>Jerome in Ep. ad Tit.</i> c. i. [The editor has failed in
   discovering the passage here alluded to, although the Benedictine
   and several earlier editions have been consulted.]"</p>


<p>Without waiting for an opportunity of referring to the Benedictine, or
any of the earlier editions, to which the writer has not access at the
present moment, it is sufficient to observe, that the passage in
question occurs in St. Jerome's <i>Commentary on the Epistle to Titus</i>,
and may be found in Vallarsius's edition, tom. vii. col. 694.</p>

<p>One would be glad to content oneself with this <i>note</i>, but the interests
of literature and theology demand something more; and if the anonymous
editor should feel pained by the following remarks, the writer can only
say that he has not the slightest suspicion who the editor of this
volume is, and that it is to the Committee (most especially in such a
case as this, where they have allowed the editor to withhold his name,)
the Subscribers&mdash;not to say the Church of England&mdash;will look for such a
work being brought out in a proper manner.</p>

<p>To confess that a passage, which the Convocation of 1603 have referred
to in this off-hand manner, is not to be found in the works of Jerome,
is strange enough: but the confession assumes a new character, as
regards both the editor and the Committee, when one reflects for an
instant on the particular passage which the editor thus candidly informs
us, he "has failed in discovering."</p>

<p>It is not at all too much to say, that no one could be even moderately
acquainted with the Presbyterian controversy, and the arguments in
defence of Episcopacy, without being so familiar with this passage as to
recognise it at first sight. It is, indeed, one of the chief testimonies
which the Presbyterians urged in proof of the antiquity of their
discipline,&mdash;as Bishop Pearson says: "Locus Hieronymi, quem pro fundo
habent novatores;" and, as such, it has been discussed by almost every
divine of eminence, who has undertaken to defend the constitution of the
English church.</p>

<p>To multiply references is needless. But, without attempting to exhaust
even the resources of a small and very incomplete private collection, it
will suffice to say, that Henry Dodwell has examined it in his additions
to Pearson. (<i>De Success. prim. Romæ Episcop.</i>, Diss. I. cap. ix.)
Bishop Bilson discusses it, and refers to it again and again (<i>Perpetual
Government of Christ's Church</i>, "Epistle to the Reader," p. 5.; ch. xi.
pp. 217. 268.; ch. xii. pp. 284. 289. 307.; edit. Oxford, 1842). Hooker
quotes and explains it (book vii. ch. v. 7.; vol. iii. p. 162.; Oxford,
1845). It is the subject of an entire section of Jeremy Taylor's
<i>Episcopacy asserted</i> (sect. xxi.). And to enumerate no more, it is
fully discussed by Archbishop Potter, in his <i>Discourse on Church
Government</i> (chap. iv.).</p>

<p>These facts will, it is trusted, exempt the writer from the charge of
minute and carping criticism. The Convocation of 1603, indeed, merely
allude to the passage as one with which every English divine would be
familiar and most unquestionably no one could have been a stranger to
it, who was acquainted with the subject which the Convocation were
discussing.</p>

<p>It is surely then but reasonable to feel surprised, that a document so
important, and drawn up by men of such eminence, should have been
confided to an editor who had never heard of the passage, and knew not
where to find it: in a word, to an editor, who, by his own
acknowledgment (and his candour is deserving of respect), is a stranger
to one of the principal subjects of the volume he was employed to edit.</p>

<p>The Committee of the <i>Anglo-Catholic Library</i> are not persons who
require to be informed, that something more is demanded in an editor,
than industry in hunting out references, and transcribing scraps of
Latin. Nor could this passage have presented an instant's difficulty to
some whose names have stood on the list of the Committee from the
commencement of the undertaking. But this is the very thing which the
Subscribers have a right to complain of. They expected that the editors
employed should have the benefit of co-operation and consultation with
the Committee. They had a right to expect this. The Subscribers cannot
be expected to feel satisfied with the unrevised performance of an
anonymous editor. They had a right to expect, in the first place, that
the Committee would not engage any one to edit a book until they had
ascertained whether he was acquainted with the subject of which it
treated. They had a right to expect also, that the Committee would
exercise such a real and <i>bonâ fide</i> superintendence and control as
should have prevented the possibility of any work, issued with the
sanction of their names, containing a confession so strange and so
humiliating, and manifesting a degree of editorial incompetency so
disappointing to the Subscribers, and so discreditable to the literary
and theological character of the country. The names of the gentlemen of
the Committee<a id="Page_367"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[367]</span> must be regarded as a pledge and guarantee that no
such case as this could occur. On the faith of that assurance, and in
the hope of receiving valuable editions of our standard theology, as
well as with a wish to encourage a most useful undertaking, many persons
have given their names and their subscriptions. There is too much reason
to think now that this assurance is of less value than could have been
anticipated. And when proof so unquestionable is thus forced on one's
notice, it can scarcely be thought surprising, that regret and
disappointment should be expressed by one who has been, from the
beginning,</p>

<h3>
<span>THE USE OF MISERERES.</span>
</h3>


<p>I notice the following paragraph in Mr. Howitt's <i>Visits to Remarkable
Places</i>, 1840, pp. 470, 471.:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Perhaps the most curious things about the chapel [of Winchester
   College] are the ancient stall-seats now affixed to the wall of
   the ante-chapel. These have their seats so fixed upon hinges that
   those who sit in them can only maintain their position by
   balancing themselves with care, and resting their elbows on the
   seat-arms; so that if the monks who used them dropped asleep
   during divine service, the seats came forward and pitched them
   headlong upon the floor; nay, if they only dozed and nodded the
   least in the world, the hard oaken seat clapped against the hard
   oaken back, and made a noise loud enough to attract the attention
   of the whole audience. Nothing was ever more cleverly contrived
   to keep people awake at church or chapel; and, no doubt, most of
   us know where they would be especially useful now."</p>

<p>On the latter point there is little room for doubt; but allow me to ask
whether this account of the use of the <i>miserere</i> can be supported by
adequate authority, and is anything more than a joke? Mediæval monks
were, doubtless, sometimes caught napping; since Dr. Maitland (<i>Dark
Ages</i>, 2nd edit. pp. 336. and 337. n.) mentions an amusing expedient
employed in the monastery of Clugni for the detection of drowsy
brethren. What I doubt is, whether the <i>miserere</i> was intended for that
useful purpose. In the <i>Glossary of Architecture</i> (4th edit. p. 242.)
its use is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"They [<i>misereres</i>] were allowed in the Roman Catholic church as
   a relief to the infirm during the long services that were
   required to be performed by the ecclesiastics in a standing
   posture."</p>

<p>In such matters, I should imagine Mr. Parker to be a better authority
than his versatile contemporary; but if they were intended and permitted
only for the <i>infirm</i>, it seems rather remarkable that they are so
general in most cathedral or monastic churches that retain their ancient
fittings. I would also ask when were they first introduced, and by whose
authority?</p>

<h3>
<span>JOCELINE'S LEGACY.</span>
</h3>

<p><i>The Mother's Legacy to her unborn Child</i>, by Elizabeth Joceline. This
is the title to a thin octave volume printed at "Oxford at the Theater
for the satisfaction of the person of quality herein concerned, 1684."
This, the first edition, is of rare occurrence; that in the British
Museum being a dirty duodecimo chap book. "The Approbation" of the
volume bears the signature of "Thos. Goad." It is addressed as a legacy
"to her truly and most dearly-loved husband, Tourell Joceline." The
letter to her husband, and <i>The Mother's Legacy</i>, are two of as
beautiful, pious, and feeling compositions, as were ever penned by
woman. The latter is so full of religious instruction and exhortation to
faith in the mercies of a Redeemer, under the apprehension that she
might not survive the birth of a child, that it is surprising this
valuable little tract has not become a standard book for distribution by
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.</p>

<p>My reason for bringing it under the notice of the correspondents of
"N<span class="smcap lowercase">OTES AND</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIES</span>" is my strong desire to learn of what family was
Tourell Joceline, the husband of this most excellent lady. Of that of
the lady herself, I gather the following particulars from Mr. Goad's
Approbation of the volume.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Joceline was the wife of Tourell Joceline, granddaughter of
Doctor Chaderton, sometime Master of Queen's College, Cambridge, and
Professor of Divinity in that university; afterwards Bishop, first of
Chester, and then of Lincoln; by whom she was, from her tender years,
carefully nurtured. Her father was Sir Richard Brooke; her mother the
daughter of Dr. Chaderton. She was born in 1595, and died in childbed in
1622, six years after her marriage, as she seems to have anticipated;
and hence her previous writing of the <i>Legacy</i>. The child, a daughter,
survived the mother.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The two Kings of Brentford.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Occasionally when there is an expression
of ultra-friendship on the part of two persons who were before supposed,
their profession to the contrary notwithstanding, to hate each other
right heartily, the following comparison is elicited from the
bystanders: "They are like the two kings of Brentford smelling at one
nosegay." I have sought for the meaning of this <i>profound</i> remark from
many denizens of that ancient locality, but hitherto without success; it
being, somewhat like the mud of Brentford, impenetrable.</p>

<p>Presuming that the remark, like most popular sayings, bears reference to
some foregone fact or event, I shall feel obliged by some one of your
contributors stating to what the adage refers, and what it is meant to
imply. Does it bear any relation to the fact that the two members for
Middlesex are nominated at Brentford? And is the comparison quoted from
any and what work?</p>

    <p class="right">  E. J. HYTCHE.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[The saying owes its rise to the celebrated farce of <i>The

   is said that no less than ten years were employed in collecting
   and polishing the materials. The original hero was Davenant,
   satirized under the name of Bilboa; but Dryden eventually became
   its Bayes. The allusion referred to by our correspondent is to
   Act II. Sc. 2., where the stage direction is, "Enter the two
   Kings, hand in hand,"&mdash;where they probably did so&mdash;"smelling at

<h3>
<span>ANACHRONISMS OF PAINTERS.<br />
(Vol. iii., pp. 369. 517.; Vol. iv., p. 150.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I have read D'Israeli's list of the above, to which J. E. alludes in
Vol. iii., p. 369., and they are certainly well-known glaring instances
of the inconsistencies and absurdities into which artists may be led by
ignorance and total want of good taste and feeling: those given by J.
E., at the same page, are also unhappy examples. I cannot, however,
think that the instance, given by G. T. R. in Vol. iii., p. 517.,
deserves to be placed in the same category: the subject is, The Woman
taken in Adultery; and G. T. R. complains of the anachronism of
Steenwyk's having represented our Saviour as writing on the ground in
<i>Dutch</i>. But this is not necessarily the result of ignorance, and is
justifiable on the ground of making the painting more intelligible to
his countrymen. For the same reason the writing is often in Latin; and,
in fact, often as the subject has been painted, I do not recollect any
instance of the proper language being used. In making the scene take
place in a building of the architecture of the thirteenth century,
Steenwyk has erred (if error it be) in company with the best Italian
masters. Both Tintoretto and Paul Veronese engraft into their paintings
the architecture and other accessories of their own day. In Tintoretto's
celebrated picture of the Marriage of Cana, the artist has made use of
the drinking vessels and loaves of bread still used in Venice at the
present day. In fact, if strict accuracy were contended for, not a
single representation by the old masters of this subject, and of the
Last Supper, would pass muster, as, according to the facts of the case,
our Saviour and His disciples would not be sitting at a table, but
reclining on the ground. But I think these liberties not only
defensible, but that the artist's faculty of thus introducing
successfully into his paintings the scenes passing before his eyes is
often a great proof of his genius; and pictures often owe much of their
power and reality to this very circumstance. Space, as well as time, is
often annihilated not from ignorance or<a id="Page_370"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[370]</span>  inadvertence, but
purposely, and with the most happy results. Tintoretto, in a painting of
the Entombment of Christ, has introduced the stable of Bethlehem in the
background; thus finely contrasting the birthplace of Him who was found
"lying in a manger" with the fulfillment of the prophecy of His being
"with the rich in His death:" and such liberties both of time and place
are equally allowable in pictures of at all an imaginative character,
the artist feeling that by sacrificing a minor and lower truth he can
gain a higher, or make his subject appeal more to the sympathies of his
spectators. The instance also noticed by P. P. in Vol. iv., p. 150., is
no mistake, but a legitimate employment of a symbol: the cross or flag,
with the motto "Ecce Agnus Dei," soon became the recognised symbol of
St. John the Baptist, and as such was generally used without reference
to the exact time when the motto became strictly applicable. The same
strict criticism which would disallow this license, would require the
Madonna to be always painted as a Jewess: but I cannot think that
paintings are fairly liable to such close and prosaic scrutiny. P. P.'s
instance of Zebedee's sons being represented as young children, is
treading on more doubtful ground, and some great counterbalancing gain
to the picture would alone justify such a bold alteration of facts: but
if the subject be altogether treated in an allegorical manner, it might
be defensible. His modern instances are, of course, sheer blunders, and
cannot be too severely reprehended; and artists must always remember
that such liberties should never be taken, unless by these means some
higher object is gained. Nor should modern painters expect the same
indulgence, until they express in their works the same spirit of
devotion, and simple, childlike earnestness of feeling, which
distinguish the early painters of the Italian Religious School.</p>

</h3>


<p>I have the pleasure of being able to refer M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARTIN</span> to an
interpretation of this inscription. The mystical word <span class="smcap lowercase">AGLA</span> belongs to
that species of Cabbala, used by the Rabbinical writers, which is called
<i>Notaricon</i>, and which consists of forming one word out of the initial
letters of a sentence. Thus Agla is composed of the initials of</p>

<p class="center">

<p class="noindent">Attâh-Gibbor-Leholâm-Adonâi ("Thou art strong for ever, O Lord!"), and
signifies either "I reveal," or "a drop of dew," and is the cabbalistic
name of God.</p>

<p>They also reversed this process, and made an entire sentence from the
letters of one word: thus of
<span title="[Hebrew: Bereshith]">&#1489; &#1512; &#1488; &#1513; &#1514;</span> Bereshith,

<span>COLONIES IN ENGLAND.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 272.)</span>
</h3>


<p>"The inhabitants of Haverfordwest derived their origin from Flanders,
and were sent by Henry I. to inhabit these districts; a people brave and
robust, ever hostile to the Welsh; a people, I say, well versed in
commerce and woollen manufactures; a people anxious to seek gain by sea
and land, in defiance of fatigue or danger; a hardy race, equally fitted
for the plough and sword; a people brave and happy," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Giraldus
Cambrensis.</i></p>

<p>"A.D. 1107. About this season a great part of Flanders being drowned by
an inundation, or breaking in of the sea, a great number of Flemings
came to England beseeching the king to have some void part assigned to
them, wherein they might inhabit. At the first they were appointed to
the countrie lieing on the east part of the Tweed; but within four years
after<a id="Page_371"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[371]</span> they were removed into a corner by the sea-side in Wales,
called Pembrokeshire, to the end that they might be a defence there
against the unquiet Welsh. It would appear by some writers that this
multitude of Flemings consisted not onlie of such as came over about
that time, by reason their countrie was overflowed with the sea [as ye
have heard], but also others that arrived there <i>long before</i>, even in
the daies of William the Conqueror, through the friendship of the queen,
their countriewoman, sithens their numbers so increased that the realme
of England was sore pestered with them; whereupon King Henrie devised to
place them in Pembrokeshire, as well to avoide them out of the other of
England, as also by their helpe to tame the bold and presumptuous
Welshmen: which thing in those parts they brought verie well to pass;
for after they were settled there, they valiantlie resisted their
enemies, and made verie sharp wars upon them, sometimes with loss and
sometimes with gaine."&mdash;<i>Holinshed.</i></p>

<p>"Wallenses Rex Henricus, semper in rebellionem crebris expeditionibus in
deditionem premebat; consilioque salubri nixus, ut eorum tumorem
extenuaret, Flandrenses omnes Angliæ accolas eò traduxit. Plures enim,
qui tempore patris pro matris paternà cognatione confluxerant,
occultabat Angliâ, adeo ut ipsi regno pro multitudine onerosi
viderentur. Quapropter omnes cum substantiis et necessitudinibus apud
Rôs provinciam Walliarum, velut in sentinam congessit, ut et regnum
defæcaret, et hostium brutam temeritatem retunderet."&mdash;<i>William of
Malmsbury.</i></p>

<p>"The yeare 1108 the rage of the sea did overflow and drowne a great part
of the lowe countrie of Flanders, in such sort that the inhabitants were
driven to seeke themselves other dwellings; who came to King Henrie and
desired him to give some voide place to remaine in; who being very
liberal of that which was not his owne, gave them the lande of Rôs, in
Dyvet or West Wales, where Pembroke, Tenby, and Haverfordwest are now
built; and there they remaine till this daie, as may be well perceived
by their speeche and conditions, farre differing from the rest of the
countrie."&mdash;<i>Powell's Welsh Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>A similar colony is located in that part of Glamorgan called Gower; and
the Flemish population, both of Rôs and of Gower, still retain many
peculiar customs and words; while they scrupulously keep aloof from the
Welsh, each people looking down upon the other, and considering
intermarriage as a degradation. I have been told by a friend that
Flemish colonies were also located in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. This
much is certain: in the last-named county fields are occasionally
divided between different proprietors, in the manner known as
"landshares," a custom which prevails to a great extent in Gower, and
also, I believe, in Rôs. Am I right in considering this Flemish
peculiarity?</p>

 <p class="right"> S<span class="smcap lowercase">ELEUCUS.</span></p>

<p>In an ancient map of this town, Pembroke (South Wales), of which the
language is Norman-French, two districts of ours are mentioned thus: <i>Le
grene</i>, which is now called "the green;" and <i>Monton</i>, now called
"mountain." As regards the first, not a portion of <i>green</i> is
discoverable; it is a disagreeable street, close to a large mill and
sheet of water, with none of the conditions of a country green. I have
often wondered at the name, feeling persuaded that there never could
have existed such a spot here as would be so called, and was puzzled
till I last week saw this old map. Tracing the matter, although no
French substantive seems to exist spelled <i>grene</i>, the v.n. <i>grener</i> and
its relatives afford a solution&mdash;as <i>grenier</i> is a granary, and
<i>grenetis</i> the mill round a coin: so that I take it for granted, as our
<i>green</i> in fact is in the immediate neighbourhood of the corn-mill, that
from said pounding or grinding (<i>grener</i>) it solely is derived.</p>

<p>The solution of "mountain" is not so easy. It is a portion of the town
outside the old fortifications, at the <i>foot</i> of a high hill; so never
could have been dignified by the term "mountain" from its height,&mdash;in
fact, it rises but little from the estuary, one arm of which here
terminates. The tide here ceases; up to this spot "la marée <i>monte</i>." Am
I right in conjecturing that <i>montant</i> (pronounced just like <i>monton</i>),
meaning "rising" as well as mounting, may be the origin of the
designation?</p>

<p>All the early memorials of Pembroke are either Norman or Flemish, those
foreigners having settled here. We have no token of Welsh; perhaps there
are not six people in the town who can speak the language. The names of
some of the inhabitants are French and Flemish, and it is to be noted
that their personal appearance corresponds with the type of their
ancestral country. Our parish clerk, named <i>Freyne</i>, is a little
Frenchman to all intents and purposes; and our street-keeper, <i>Rushaut</i>,
has all the square stolidity and heavy features of the Low Countries.</p>

<p>Although unconnected with the foregoing, will you allow space for
another record? Only within a few years the last of a family, invariably
called "Cromwell," died. It was not their true name, but they have held
it to perpetuate the treason of their ancestor, who followed the great
Protector after he had temporarily abandoned the siege of Pembroke

here and Tenby, this unworthy townsman told the general to return, as
the garrison were reduced "to a bean a day." The advice was followed.
Pembroke was taken; but the stern captor ordered the traitor to be
hanged! Thenceforward the family ever went by the name of Cromwell.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "John Maxwell was at first promoted to the Sees of Killala and
   Achonry, and afterwards translated to the archbishopric of Tuam.
   He writ a Treatise intitled, Sacro-Sancta Regum Majestas; Printed
   London, 1643 or 1644, 4to., which he published under the name of
   J.A. In answer to which came out a Tract intitled, Lex, Rex; The
   Law and the Prince, a dispute for the just Prerogative of King
   and People. Containing the Reasons and Causes of the most
   necessary defensive Wars of the Kingdom of Scotland, and of their
   expedition for the aid and help of their dear brethren in

<span><i>Grimsditch</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., pp. 192. 330.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;There is a wood so called in
the parish of Saffron Walden, which has long formed a part of the Audley
End estates. It is about a mile from the town, situated on the crest of
a steep hill, on the south side of the road leading to Linton, and from
its commanding position may have been at some time a military station.
Some portions of a fosse may still be traced on the lower edge of the
wood; but no tradition connected with its history has descended to us.
Warton, in his <i>Account of Kiddington</i>, Oxon, p. 62., edition 1815,
observes that Stukeley describes a fosse called Grimsditch, near
Ditchley House, between Stunsfield and Chipping Norton, the vallum of
which was eastward. He also says that the word means "the ditch made by
magic," and was indiscriminately applied to ancient trenches, roads, and
boundaries, whether British, Roman, Saxon, or Danish.</p>

<p>We learn from the same work, that there exists a vallum, or ridged bank,
within two miles of Ewelme, and near to Nuffield, called Grimsditch; and
the lands adjoining to it are described in a charter in or before the
reign of Richard I. as "extra fossatum de Grimisdic."</p>

<p> Well may Mr. Layard plead the interest felt in the discoveries on
   the site of Nineveh as a reason for the publication in a cheap
   and popular form of his <i>Nineveh and its Remains</i>: and we know no
   work better calculated to give value to Mr. Murray's <i>Reading for
   the Rail than A Popular Account of Discoveries at Nineveh</i>. By
   Austen Henry Layard, Esq., D.C.L. <i>Abridged by him from his
   larger Work.</i> The value of Mr. Layard's first and larger
   publication has been so generally recognised, that in calling
   attention to the present work, with its numerous and spirited
   woodcuts, we feel bound to confine ourselves to pointing out the
   plan pursued by the author in his abridgment; namely, that of
   omitting the second part of the original work, and introducing
   the principal Biblical and historical illustrations into the
   narrative, which has thereby been rendered more useful and
   complete. "As recent discoveries," observes Mr. Layard, "and the
   contents of the inscriptions, so far as they have been
   satisfactorily decyphered, have confirmed nearly all the opinions
   expressed in the original work, no changes on any material points
   have been introduced into this abridgment. I am still inclined to
   believe that all the ruins explored represent the site of ancient
   Nineveh; and whilst still assigning the later monuments to the
   kings mentioned in Scripture, Shalmanezer, Sennacherib, and
   Essarhadon, I am convinced that a considerable period elapsed
   between their foundation and the erection of the older palaces of
   Nimroud."</p>

  <p> After the pictures which our facetious contemporary Punch has
   furnished of the troubles which an "unprotected female"
   encounters, who ventures beyond the quiet circle of her domestic
   duties, one is predisposed to regard as a heroine a lady who
   ventures unattended on a voyage round the world. Madame Ida
   Pfeiffer has done this; and her narrative of her adventures
   having excited great attention both in Germany and this country,
   Messrs. Longman have shown themselves excellent caterers for the
   reading public, by printing as the new parts of their
   <i>Traveller's Library</i>, a selected translation of them by Mrs.
   Percy Sinnett, under the title of <i>A Lady's Voyage round the
   World</i>. The work will be read with great pleasure and interest;
   and while we wonder at the writer's extraordinary passion for
   travelling, we feel that she has produced such an amusing and
   instructive volume that we are glad that she had the opportunity
   of indulging it. Mrs. Sinnett well characterises the book on
   which she has employed her talents as a translator when she says,
   "Its chief attraction will most likely be found in the personal
   narrative and in the singular character of the authoress; who
   though apparently far removed by circumstances from the romantic
   or adventurous, yet passes through the most surprising scenes,
   and encounters the most imminent perils with a calm and
   unconscious heroism that can hardly fail to command admiration."</p>


<p>   <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i> announces that the King of Denmark has
   conferred the Order of Dannebrog on M. Worsaae, the author of the
   <i>Primeval Antiquities of Denmark</i>, and other important works.
   This will be gratifying intelligence to all who had the pleasure
   of making the acquaintance of this accomplished antiquary during
   his visit to this country. We hope the time is not far distant
   when similar distinctions will be conferred in England on men of
   learning. The necessity for the institution of some

work is in every respect accommodated to the present advanced state of

their Latitude and Longitude, and the Number of the Map in which they
will be found.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"We are now in possession of an 'Atlas' which comprehends every
discovery of which the present century can boast. Not a village nor a
rivulet rendered famous by victory&mdash;not a single hamlet jotted down in
the itinerary of the adventurous traveler&mdash;not a single spot which
theodolite or aneroid barometer could determine with accuracy, has been
omitted in the map.... To crown the whole, there is a superb index, upon
the most approved plan, with a faithful enumeration of latitudes and
longitudes. This 'Atlas' ought at once to supersede all other works of
the kind, and no one, either in pursuit of truth on his own account, or

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
